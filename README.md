# Getting started
Open `PM_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab and follow the instructions there.

Alternatively or in case you get stuck, you can also look at the already executed Jupyter Notebook named `PM_Analysis-executed.ipynb`, which contains all the expected outputs including plots.

# Data Source
The PM sensor data comes from https://archive.sensor.community/ and has only been slightly transformed by aggregating all single day measurement CSV files from one sensor into one large CSV file.

The original data from the sensor.community is licensed under the Open Database License: http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/ (see https://archive.sensor.community/00disclamer.md for details). The derived data in this repository is published under the same terms and license.
